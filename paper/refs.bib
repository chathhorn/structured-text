      abstract = {Off-the-shelf intrusion detection systems prove an ill fit for
            protecting industrial control systems, as they do not take their process
            semantics into account. Specifically, current systems fail to detect
            recent process control attacks that manifest as unauthorized changes to
            the configuration of a plant's programmable logic controllers (PLCs). In
            this work we present a detector that continuously tracks updates to
            corresponding process variables to then derive variable-specific
            prediction models as the basis for assessing future activity. Taking a
            specification-agnostic approach, we passively monitor plant activity by
            extracting variable updates from the devices' network communication. We
            evaluate the capabilities of our detection approach with traffic recorded
            at two operational water treatment plants serving a total of about one
            million people in two urban areas. We show that the proposed approach can
            detect direct attacks on process control, and we further explore its
            potential to identify more sophisticated indirect attacks on field device
            measurements as well.},
